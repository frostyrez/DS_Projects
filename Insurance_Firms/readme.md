# Comparing and Evaluating Insurance Firms

In this project, a Supervision Manager has asked for help allocating scarce resources and identifying which firms their team should focus on. Supervisory resource may be allocated according to the following 
characteristics:

- Firm size (i.e. the biggest firms need more attention)   
- Changing business profile (are firmsâ€™ data changing substantially year-on-year?)   
- Outliers from the norm (when looking at a single reporting period, does a firm deviate 
significantly from the average?)

## Report 1: Resource Allocation Proposal
Once the data was fully cleaned and processed, several insights were distilled. Please see accompanying report for further details.
### Largest Firms
